# Additional dependencies for Crime Gun DB integration (v_2)
#
# CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTIONS:
# =========================
# Merge these into the main requirements.txt file.
# The spaCy dependency is OPTIONAL - the extractor will work without it
# but NLP-based jurisdiction extraction will be disabled.

# Required (should already be in requirements.txt)
openpyxl>=3.1.0
pandas>=2.0.0

# Optional: NLP extraction
# Uncomment if implementing Priority 4 (NLP on narratives)
# spacy>=3.7.0

# After installing spacy, download the model:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
