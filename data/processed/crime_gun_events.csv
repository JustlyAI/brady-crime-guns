As the vehicle left, a traffic stop was conducted on the vehicle at which point Davon’s GPS became active again. After conducting the traffic stop, Detectives were able to pull surveillance video of Ironn entering the apartment building where they observed him displaying characteristics of an armed gunman. During this time they were able to identify apartment B1 as the residence in the apartment building and made contact with the homeowner who confirmed Ironn has access to the apartment.
Detectives applied for and were granted a search warrant for the residence at which point they located and recovered a Black in color Polymer 80 9mm handgun with an extended magazine loaded with a total of 28 rounds of 9mm ammunition and a Black in color Smith & Wesson M&P 9 Shield 9mm (#NJP5701) handgun loaded with 9 rounds of 9mm ammunition.

While establishing surveillance on the residence, Davon exited the rear door and immediately attempted to flee upon seeing officers. After a brief pursuit Davon was taken into custody, once in custody Davon’s GPS was observed to be wrapped in aluminum foil. 

Updated Arrest: On August 19th, 2024 CGIC detectives and City Watch (Sierra) observed Ironn Collins-Demby in the area of 24th and Market.

After a brief struggle, Ironn was taken into custody.  During the brief struggle, Ironn was observed discarding a firearm from the front of his waistband off of the porch.  
Once in custody, detectives recovered a black in color Girsan Regard MC 9mm firearm (SN T6368-20A00617) which was found to be loaded with a total of 13 rounds of 9mm ammunition.  During a search of Ironn, he was found in possession of .3 grams of crack cocaine.
