## Type 1: Long-Form Blog Example

**Topic:** Context Engineering (synthesized from the series)
**Length:** ~2000 words
**Key elements:** Builds authority through citations, provides comprehensive framework, practical implementation

### Analysis of Effective Elements:

- Opens by positioning against established terminology ("prompt engineering")
- Cites industry authority (Karpathy, Anthropic) for credibility
- Provides numbered framework (4 components)
- Includes code-formatted examples
- Litigation-specific applications throughout
- Builds to practical implementation
- Acknowledges learning curve without being discouraging

### Representative Excerpts:

**Strong opening with authority citation:**
> Throughout 2025, AI researchers and practitioners made a decisive terminology shift. In June, Andrej Karpathy (former OpenAI director) endorsed replacing "prompt engineering" with "context engineering," explaining that industrial-strength AI applications require "the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information."

**Framework introduction:**
> Consider how a litigation team might organize their context into four essential components. This is one approach—you'll discover what works best for your practice:

**Practical application:**
> This modular approach lets you mix and match context components as needed. Running document review? Attach System + Matter + Task contexts. Drafting a motion? Add Strategic context. Meeting with client? Maybe just Matter + Strategic.

## Type 2: Regular Blog Examples

### Example A: Tool Introduction (NotebookLM)

**Length:** ~450 words
**Tone:** Professional, feature-focused, enabling

**What works:**
- Leads with differentiation, not features
- "Only tool in our portfolio that..." establishes unique value
- Bullet points with bold labels for scannability
- Clear next steps with specific actions

**Opening:**
> As we continue to expand our AI toolkit, one platform stands out for its unique ability to transform how teams collaborate around complex document sets: Google NotebookLM Enterprise.

### Example B: Methodology Post (Priming)

**Length:** ~700 words
**Tone:** Educational, sophisticated, collegial

**What works:**
- Uses familiar analogy (briefing a colleague) to introduce concept
- Multi-turn dialogue example shows exactly what to do
- "Why This Works" section explains the reasoning
- Connects to broader series

**Analogy setup:**
> Think about briefing a colleague on a complex assignment. You provide case background and procedural posture, explain strategic considerations, and clarify output expectations. You confirm they understand before they begin.
>
> Then you ask them to confirm their understanding. They reflect back the framework: "So we're analyzing under Delaware law, focusing on fiduciary duty claims, with special attention to Revlon given the sale context?"

### Example C: Quick Win (Voice Access)

**Length:** ~300 words
**Tone:** Conversational, practical, friendly

**What works:**
- Opens with conceptual hook (voice = natural processing)
- "Did you know" creates discovery moment
- Numbered steps are dead simple
- Playful sign-off ("Happy chatting!")

**Opening:**
> Voice is how we naturally process complex ideas—talking through arguments, articulating strategy, thinking out loud.
>
> Did you know that your Windows 11 computer already has Voice Access built in?

### Example D: Conceptual Framework (Verification Paradox)

**Length:** ~600 words
**Tone:** Analytical, substantive, slightly provocative

**What works:**
- Introduces formula (N = EG − VC) for analytical punch
- Cites multiple authorities (Pichai, Karpathy, law review)
- "Three Realities" framework organizes complex topic
- Doesn't oversimplify professional challenge

**Formula introduction:**
> A forthcoming Law Review article, "The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI Use in Legal Practice" by Joshua Yuvaraj, proposes a formula that reframes how we should think about AI value in professional services:
>
> N = EG − VC
>
> Where N is Net Value, EG is Efficiency Gain, and VC is Verification Cost.

## Type 3: LinkedIn Post Examples

Actual high-performing LinkedIn posts from Laurent's feed.

### Example A: The Coding Agent Vision

**Topic:** Coding agents as preview of legal AI future
**Performance:** High engagement
**Hook type:** Builds on thought leader (Mollick)

```
Ethan Mollick's latest piece on AI as "wizards" provides the perfect backdrop for something I've been wanting to share: The best preview of what's coming to all knowledge work is already here in coding agents.

Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Factory, and Cline aren't just for developers. These agents read, write, grep, search the web, and manipulate entire file systems, treating any structured text—legal documents, research papers, contracts—with the same sophisticated pattern recognition they apply to code.

The catch today is working in an IDE or terminal, which most lawyers have never touched. But the payoff is immediate—these agents can draft lengthy documents, spot inconsistencies across hundreds of contracts, and build custom analysis tools on demand. The same agent that refactors a codebase transforms how you handle discovery documents or regulatory filings.

Mollick highlights Google's NotebookLM as a gentler introduction to this shift from co-intelligence to conjuring—feed it documents and watch it create without your input. Expect many more NotebookLM-style interfaces that make working with agents more accessible soon.

By learning to work with these wizards now, as Mollick describes them, you could access the most powerful applications of AI available today and mastering tomorrow's workflow while everyone else debates whether to trust yesterday's tools.
```

**What works:**
- Opens by building on respected thought leader
- Technical credibility (specific tools named)
- Insider framing ("most lawyers have never touched")
- Forward-looking without being preachy
- No hashtags in this one (optional)

### Example B: The Provocative Prediction

**Topic:** Future of associate work
**Performance:** High engagement
**Hook type:** Bold prediction with specific timeframe

```
By 2027, junior BigLaw associates will spend the majority of their billable hours reviewing AI-generated work.

Someone has to do it. Every brief, contract, memo, report that AI generates needs human review before it touches a client, counterparty, court, or regulator. That's professional responsibility, not optional. These billable hours will be regarded as essential and therefore valuable to clients.

Ilona Logvinova calls this our new supervisory role—I call it the new doc review.

AI systems can review or draft in minutes what takes associates days. But that output still needs to pass discerning eyes. Unlike traditional doc review, you're reviewing distilled information, analysis, legal arguments, clauses. Not raw documents and mounds of inapt cases or precedents.

Less wheel spinning, less waste. Better work, same hours. Net positive for everyone?

Marlene Gebauer and Greg Lambert—nobody does a better job getting out perspectives and ideas that really matter
```

**What works:**
- Hook is a specific, dated prediction
- "Someone has to do it" - short punchy follow-up
- Credits multiple people (Logvinova, Gebauer, Lambert)
- Ends with question driving engagement
- Takes a position without hedging

### Example C: The Direct Challenge

**Topic:** What lawyers actually need
**Performance:** High engagement
**Hook type:** Attention grab + direct question

```
Now that I have your attention....

Who's building Cline for Word?

If you haven't heard of Cline, it's an AI agent that lives as an extension in VS Code (MSFT's word processor for developers). Cline is open source. Free. Connects to any data source.

Coding agents have completely transformed how developers work. What hit me recently is that this is all lawyers need. Not another expensive and overstuffed legal AI platform. Just Cline. For Word.

Think about it—we live in documents. Put an AI agent directly in Word, connected to your files or DMS, the internet, and all the data you need—including that case law dataset from my last post—and you've solved 80% of legal AI use cases.

The tech exists. LLMs, MCP connectors, APIs—it's all there. Someone just needs to put it together where lawyers actually work. That's it. That's the whole game.

Who gets this?
```

**What works:**
- Meta-hook ("Now that I have your attention")
- Immediate question
- Technical explanation made accessible
- "Think about it—" transition
- Strong closing: "That's it. That's the whole game."
- Ends with challenge question

### Example D: Breaking News Framing

**Topic:** Open-sourced case law dataset
**Performance:** High engagement
**Hook type:** News announcement with implications

```
Apparently a comprehensive set of case law has been open sourced and will be maintained on Hugging Face

If the claim of "99% of US caselaw" being freely available is true, then that is huge news for legal tech, startups, KM & Innovation groups, and indeed the entire legal industry. The pairing of such a dataset and AI agents with genius-level reasoning is monumentally useful. Not only does it unlock many, many use cases and AI-driven services, it substantially lowers the cost of using and delivering services. It means that Supreme Court-caliber briefs can be written from first principles for the cost of compute.

Near infinite capabilities, no Westlaw or Lexis subscription needed.

If the dataset checks out. What are people learning?
```

**What works:**
- "Apparently" - honest uncertainty
- Conditional framing ("If the claim is true")
- Specific implications spelled out
- Bold statement: "Supreme Court-caliber briefs... for the cost of compute"
- Ends seeking validation: "What are people learning?"
