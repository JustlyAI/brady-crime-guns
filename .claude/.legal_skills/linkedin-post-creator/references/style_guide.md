# Laurent Wiesel Style Guide

Detailed voice, tone, and formatting guidelines for creating authentic content across all three formats.

## Voice Principles

### Core Voice Attributes

**Practitioner, Not Evangelist**
- You build and use these tools daily
- Technical credibility comes from doing, not just observing
- Bridge two worlds: elite legal practice and AI engineering

**Confident Without Arrogance**
- Assert insights directly
- Back claims with evidence or authority citations
- Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists ("If the claim checks out...")

**Analytical and Framework-Oriented**
- Love numbered components and structured approaches
- Occasional formulas for punch (N = EG - VC)
- Break complexity into digestible pieces

**Slightly Irreverent**
- Break formality strategically
- Occasional dry humor
- Never at the expense of substance

**Intellectually Generous**
- Credit others freely (Mollick, industry voices)
- Share insights without gatekeeping
- Invite discussion and alternative views

## Tone by Format

### Long-Form Blog

**Tone:** Authoritative, comprehensive, professorial but accessible

**Characteristics:**
- Build arguments methodically
- Cite industry authorities for credibility
- Acknowledge nuance and learning curves
- Synthesis that ties threads together

**Language patterns:**
- "Throughout 2025, researchers made a decisive shift..."
- "Consider how a litigation team might..."
- "This approach transforms..."
- "The uncomfortable truth..."

### Regular Blog

**Tone:** Professional, practical, collegial

**Characteristics:**
- Get to value fast
- Focused on single concept or technique
- Practical implementation guidance
- Connect to broader themes when relevant

**Language patterns:**
- "Here's the insight..."
- "Think about briefing a colleague..."
- "This transforms AI from basic assistant to..."
- "Start with... See what happens."

### LinkedIn Post

**Tone:** Conversational, punchy, provocative when warranted

**Characteristics:**
- Hook immediately - first line must stop the scroll
- Short paragraphs, often single sentences
- Direct questions to drive engagement
- Industry insider framing

**Language patterns:**
- "The best preview of what's coming is already here."
- "Someone has to do it."
- "Think about it—"
- "That's it. That's the whole game."
- "Who gets this?"
- "What are people learning?"

## Writing Rules

### Grammar & Style

**Active Voice Always**

❌ "Documents can be uploaded to the system"
✅ "Upload documents to the system"

❌ "The context should be validated"
✅ "Validate context against sources"

**Present Tense for Immediacy**

❌ "This tool will help you analyze documents"
✅ "This tool helps you analyze documents"

**Direct Address**

❌ "Users can create persistent repositories"
✅ "You can create persistent repositories"

❌ "Lawyers will find this valuable"
✅ "You'll find this valuable"

### Sentence Structure

**Vary Length for Rhythm**

Good:
> NotebookLM transforms team collaboration. Unlike chat-based tools where context resets, your workspace retains all sources and analysis—making it ideal for long-running matters.

Poor (all same length):
> NotebookLM transforms team collaboration around complex document sets. Unlike chat-based tools context resets after each session. Your NotebookLM workspace retains all sources and analysis. This makes it particularly ideal for long-running matters.

**Short Paragraphs**
- Maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- LinkedIn: often single sentences as paragraphs
- Create visual breathing room

**Lead with the Point**

❌ Starting with context:
> "In our experience working with litigation teams, we've found that many partners struggle with document review. NotebookLM addresses this by..."

✅ Leading with insight:
> "NotebookLM accelerates document review. Teams report 50% time savings on complex discovery matters."

### Word Choice

**Precision Over Padding**

❌ "In order to get started with using..."
✅ "To start using..."

❌ "This particular tool is designed to help with..."
✅ "This tool helps with..."

**Avoid Qualifier Overload**

❌ "This might potentially help you possibly improve..."
✅ "This helps you improve..."

❌ "We think you'll probably find that this could be useful..."
✅ "You'll find this useful for..."

**No Buzzwords Without Substance**

Avoid unless truly warranted:
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Synergy" (just no)

Prefer concrete descriptions:
- "Accelerates document review by 50%"
- "Maintains context across sessions"
- "Enables team collaboration"

### Emoji Policy

**Default: No emojis.**

Emojis have become an AI-generated content tell. They can undermine authenticity.

**Exception:** Strategic use for genuinely attention-grabbing hooks on LinkedIn when the content warrants it (breaking news, major announcement). Even then, use sparingly - one emoji max, at the start.

**Never:** Scattered throughout text, multiple emojis, or as decoration.

### Em-Dash, Colon, Semicolon Usage

**Em-dashes:** Use for emphasis or parenthetical thoughts—like this—but limit to 1-2 per post. Overuse becomes a tell.

**Colons:** Use to introduce lists or explanations. Don't overuse for dramatic effect.

**Semicolons:** Use sparingly; they work for connecting related independent clauses but can feel academic.

## LinkedIn-Specific Guidelines

### The Hook

First 1-2 lines appear before "see more." This is everything.

**Effective hooks:**
- Provocative prediction: "By 2027, junior BigLaw associates will spend the majority of their billable hours reviewing AI-generated work."
- Direct challenge: "Stop optimizing your prompts."
- Insider observation: "The best preview of what's coming to all knowledge work is already here."
- Breaking news framing: "Apparently a comprehensive set of case law has been open sourced..."

**Weak hooks:**
- Generic setup: "I've been thinking about AI lately..."
- Obvious statement: "AI is changing the legal industry."
- Question without stakes: "Have you tried ChatGPT?"

### Structure

```
[HOOK - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[CONTEXT - Why this matters, 1-2 short paragraphs]

[INSIGHT - The core observation or argument, 2-3 paragraphs]

[ENGAGEMENT DRIVER - Question or call to discussion]

[HASHTAGS - 3-5 relevant ones]
```

### Engagement Drivers

End with something that invites response:

- Direct question: "What are people learning?"
- Challenge: "Who gets this?"
- Invitation: "What's your experience?"
- Observation seeking validation: "If the dataset checks out..."

### Hashtags

- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Place at the end
- Mix broad (#LegalTech #AI) with specific (#ContextEngineering #LegalInnovation)
- No hashtags mid-text

### Links

- No external links in post body (kills reach)
- If linking needed, put in first comment
- Reference content by name instead: "Mollick's latest piece on AI as 'wizards'..."

### Name-Dropping and Citations

Credit generously and specifically:
- "Ethan Mollick's latest piece on AI as 'wizards'..."
- "Ilona Logvinova calls this our new supervisory role"
- "Marlene Gebauer and Greg Lambert—nobody does a better job..."

This builds community, shows you're engaged, and often gets engagement back.

## Authority Building Patterns

### Cite Industry Voices

- Andrej Karpathy on context engineering
- Ethan Mollick on AI capabilities
- Aaron Levie on enterprise AI
- Anthropic engineering blog
- Research papers and law reviews
- Industry practitioners doing interesting work

### Show Technical Credibility

Reference tools and concepts that demonstrate depth:
- Cline, VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code
- MCP connectors, APIs
- Hugging Face, datasets
- Token windows, context engineering

### Insider Framing

Position yourself as someone who sees what's coming:
- "The best preview of what's coming is already here"
- "The tech exists. Someone just needs to put it together."
- "This is all lawyers need. Not another expensive platform."

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Opening

❌ **Before:**
> Artificial intelligence is transforming the legal industry in many ways. I've been exploring how lawyers can use these new tools more effectively. One thing I've noticed is that context matters a lot when working with AI.

**Problems:** Generic, slow buildup, no hook

✅ **After:**
> Stop optimizing your prompts. Start engineering your context.

**Why it works:** Direct, provocative, immediate value signal

### Example 2: LinkedIn Hook

❌ **Before:**
> I've been thinking about how AI will change associate work in the coming years. It's really interesting to consider what the future might look like.

**Problems:** Weak opener, hedging, no stakes

✅ **After:**
> By 2027, junior BigLaw associates will spend the majority of their billable hours reviewing AI-generated work.

**Why it works:** Specific prediction, stakes clear, provocative enough to drive engagement

### Example 3: Technical Credibility

❌ **Before:**
> There are many AI coding tools available that lawyers might find useful for their work.

**Problems:** Vague, no specifics, passive

✅ **After:**
> Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Factory, and Cline aren't just for developers. These agents read, write, grep, search the web, and manipulate entire file systems.

**Why it works:** Specific tools, technical verbs, demonstrates knowledge

### Example 4: Closing

❌ **Before:**
> I hope you found this useful. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.

**Problems:** Weak, generic, forgettable

✅ **After:**
> The tech exists. LLMs, MCP connectors, APIs—it's all there. Someone just needs to put it together where lawyers actually work. That's it. That's the whole game.
>
> Who gets this?

**Why it works:** Confident assertion, specific technical grounding, direct challenge
