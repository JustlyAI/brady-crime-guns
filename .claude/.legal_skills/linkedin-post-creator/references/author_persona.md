# Laurent Wiesel - Author Persona

Background, positioning, and distinctive angles for authentic content creation.

## Professional Background

**Experience:** 25 years as a litigator in elite legal practice (Big Law tradition)

**Current identity:** Litigator + AI engineer + developer

**Unique positioning:** One of the few people who genuinely bridges elite legal practice and hands-on AI engineering. Not an observer or commentator—a practitioner who builds and uses these tools daily.

## Core Themes

### 1. The Future Is Already Here (In Coding Agents)

Coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Factory) are the best preview of what's coming to all knowledge work. These tools aren't just for developers—they manipulate structured text with sophisticated pattern recognition.

**Key insight:** Legal documents are structured text. The same agent that refactors a codebase transforms how you handle discovery or regulatory filings.

### 2. Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering

The industry is shifting terminology for good reason. Quality AI output depends more on the information environment you create than on how cleverly you phrase your question.

**Framework:** System Context, Matter Context, Task Context, Strategic Context

### 3. Verification Is the New Bottleneck

The verification paradox: N = EG - VC (Net Value = Efficiency Gain - Verification Cost)

AI generates fast. But every output needs human review before touching clients, courts, or regulators. This is professional responsibility, not optional.

**Provocative angle:** Verification is mid-to-senior level work. It requires judgment that junior associates don't yet have. This fundamentally changes staffing models.

### 4. Tools Should Meet Lawyers Where They Work

"Who's building Cline for Word?"

Lawyers don't need another expensive, overstuffed legal AI platform. They need agents embedded where they actually work—Word, DMS, email.

**Key insight:** The tech exists. LLMs, MCP connectors, APIs. Someone just needs to assemble it in the right place.

### 5. Dataset Liberation Changes Everything

Open-sourced case law (like comprehensive datasets on Hugging Face) paired with genius-level reasoning agents means Supreme Court-caliber briefs can be written from first principles for the cost of compute.

**Implication:** Near infinite capabilities, no Westlaw or Lexis subscription needed.

## Distinctive Angles

### What Makes Laurent Different

1. **Actually builds things** - Not just commenting on AI, but building agents, writing code, shipping tools
2. **25 years of legal context** - Understands BigLaw from the inside: billable hours, partner dynamics, professional responsibility, client relationships
3. **Technical credibility** - Speaks fluently about VS Code, MCP connectors, APIs, Hugging Face, token windows
4. **Framework thinker** - Breaks complexity into numbered components, sometimes even formulas
5. **Intellectually generous** - Credits others, invites discussion, shares insights freely

### Unique Blend

Most legal tech commentary comes from:
- Lawyers who don't code (limited technical depth)
- Technologists who don't practice law (limited practice context)
- Vendors selling platforms (biased)

Laurent occupies rare space: elite practitioner + hands-on builder. This enables observations others can't make.

## Influences and Community

### Thought Leaders to Reference

**AI/Tech:**
- Ethan Mollick (Wharton, One Useful Thing) - AI capabilities, "wizards" framing
- Andrej Karpathy - Context engineering terminology
- Aaron Levie (Box) - Enterprise AI observations
- Anthropic engineering blog - Technical insights

**Legal Tech:**
- Marlene Gebauer & Greg Lambert - Legal industry perspectives
- Ilona Logvinova - Supervisory role framing
- Industry practitioners doing interesting work

### Community Engagement

- Credit others generously and specifically
- Reference their work by name
- Invite discussion and alternative views
- Build relationships through intellectual generosity

## Content Pillars

### Primary Topics

1. **AI agents in legal practice** - How coding agents translate to legal work
2. **Context engineering** - Building effective information environments for AI
3. **Verification and quality** - The human role in AI-assisted work
4. **Tools and infrastructure** - What lawyers actually need vs. what vendors sell
5. **Future of legal work** - How roles, staffing, and workflows will evolve

### Secondary Topics

- Specific tool introductions and capabilities
- Workflow optimization techniques
- Industry developments and dataset releases
- Responses to thought leader content

## Voice Calibration

### Sound Like Laurent When You...

- Lead with counterintuitive insights
- Use legal practice analogies (briefing colleagues, delegating, deposition prep)
- Include frameworks and numbered components
- Cite industry voices for authority
- Acknowledge uncertainty honestly ("If the claim checks out...")
- Break formality with occasional dry observations
- End with direct questions or challenges

### Don't Sound Like Laurent If You...

- Open with generic AI commentary
- Use buzzwords without substance
- Hedge excessively
- Claim without evidence
- Write like a vendor pitch
- Scatter emojis throughout
- Avoid taking positions

## Positioning Statement

Laurent Wiesel translates between two worlds that rarely speak the same language: elite legal practice and AI engineering. With 25 years in litigation and hands-on experience building AI tools, he sees what's coming before most—and shares it without gatekeeping.

Not an evangelist. A practitioner who builds and uses these tools, then explains what works.
