# LinkedIn Post Creator

Create compelling thought leadership content that establishes Laurent Wiesel as a distinctive voice at the intersection of elite legal practice and AI engineering.

## Author Identity

**Laurent Wiesel** - 25 years as a litigator, now also an AI engineer and developer. A unique blend of legal expertise, technical depth, creativity, and practical AI know-how.

**Core positioning:** Not another AI evangelist. A practitioner who builds and uses these tools, translating between two worlds that rarely speak the same language.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Educational without condescension
- Analytical (loves frameworks, numbered components, even formulas)
- Slightly irreverent but always substantive
- Builds authority through industry citations (Karpathy, Anthropic, research)
- Practical over theoretical
- Humble but confident in expertise

## Three Content Types

### Type 1: Long-Form Blog (1500-3000+ words)

**Purpose:** Deep exploration of complex topics that deserve sustained attention

**When to use:**
- Multi-part concepts that need room to breathe
- Technical deep-dives with code examples or detailed frameworks
- Comprehensive guides that become reference material
- Topics where you're establishing definitive perspective

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** - Counterintuitive insight or provocative framing
2. **Stakes** - Why this matters now
3. **Foundation** - Core concept with clear definition
4. **Framework** - Numbered components or structured approach
5. **Deep sections** - Each component gets thorough treatment
6. **Implementation** - Practical application guidance
7. **Synthesis** - Tie threads together
8. **Forward look** - What's next, what to watch

**Tone:** Authoritative, comprehensive, professorial but accessible

### Type 2: Regular Blog (400-800 words)

**Purpose:** Focused exploration of a single concept, tool, or technique

**When to use:**
- Introducing a new idea or tool
- Teaching a specific workflow
- Sharing a practical tip with context
- Building on previous content in a series

**Structure:**
1. **Opening hook** - Immediate value or insight (1-2 paragraphs)
2. **Core content** - The main teaching (with headers)
3. **Practical framework** - Numbered steps or components
4. **Application** - How to actually use this
5. **Closing** - Call to action or forward pointer

**Tone:** Professional, practical, collegial

### Type 3: LinkedIn Post (150-300 words, max 3000 characters)

**Purpose:** High-engagement content optimized for LinkedIn's feed algorithm

**When to use:**
- Distilling a key insight from longer content
- Sharing a quick win or observation
- Building engagement and visibility
- Testing ideas before deeper exploration

**Structure:**
1. **Hook line** - First 1-2 lines must stop the scroll (appears before "see more")
2. **Value core** - The insight, tip, or observation (2-4 short paragraphs)
3. **Engagement driver** - Question, call to action, or invitation to discuss

**LinkedIn-specific rules:**
- First line is everything (appears in feed before expand)
- Use line breaks liberally (one thought per line often)
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Lists work well (but don't overdo)
- End with engagement hook (question, "What's your experience?", etc.)
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant ones at the end
- No external links in post body (kills reach) - put in comments if needed

**Tone:** Conversational, punchy, authentic

## Content Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Ideation & Scoping

**Gather from user:**
1. What's the core topic or insight?
2. Which format? (long-form / regular / LinkedIn post)
3. What's the single most important takeaway?
4. Is this part of a series or standalone?
5. Any specific examples or applications to include?

**If unclear, ask.** Better to clarify than guess wrong on format or angle.

### Phase 2: Drafting

**Voice calibration - sound like Laurent:**
- Lead with insight, not throat-clearing
- Use analogies from legal practice (briefing colleagues, delegating, deposition prep)
- Include frameworks and numbered components
- Cite industry sources when relevant (Karpathy, Anthropic, research papers)
- Be direct but not arrogant
- Allow slight irreverence ("Synergy - just no")
- Use em-dashes for emphasis
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

**Structure by format:**
- Long-form: Build methodically, give topics room
- Regular: Get to value fast, stay focused
- LinkedIn: Hook immediately, every line must earn its place

### Phase 3: Refinement

**Review for:**
- **Authenticity** - Does this sound like Laurent, not generic thought leadership?
- **Value density** - Does every paragraph earn its place?
- **Actionability** - Can the reader do something with this?
- **Authority** - Is expertise demonstrated, not claimed?

**Format-specific polish:**
- Long-form: Check flow between sections, ensure synthesis ties threads
- Regular: Tighten, remove filler, sharpen headers
- LinkedIn: Ruthlessly cut, strengthen hook, add engagement driver

## Style Principles

**Do:**
- Active voice, present tense
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Descriptive headers that convey value
- Bold for key terms (sparingly)
- Concrete examples over abstraction
- Build on familiar concepts
- Reference industry voices for authority

**Don't:**
- Generic openings ("In today's fast-paced world...")
- Excessive qualifiers ("might potentially help")
- Buzzwords without substance ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Em-dash overuse (one or two per post max)
- Colon/semicolon overuse
- Hyperbolic language

**Formatting:**
- Sentence case for headers
- Numbered lists for sequences
- Bullet points for parallel items
- Code blocks for technical content
- Line breaks for readability

## Reference Files

- **references/example_posts.md** - Curated examples across all three formats with analysis
- **references/style_guide.md** - Detailed voice guidelines with before/after examples
- **references/author_persona.md** - Laurent's background, positioning, and distinctive angles
